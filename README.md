The data in this repository accompanies the **curiosity manuscript** exploring the temporal dynamics of curiosity, and its  implications when deployed in our modern, technological, informationally-loaded environment.

Data files included in this repostiory
## QuestionRatings.xslx 

This excel file organizes the Urge and Interest ratings of 143 questions, as was executed by 39 participants. 
### Data collection
The instructions given to participants were as follow:


> In the following study, you will be asked to provide two types of  judgments on each of the questions below. The ratings are for the  questions' *Interest* and *Urge*, both on a scale of 1-10.  To clarify what we mean, let us explore a few examples:
>
>      1. `What is Justin Bieberâ€™s favorite breakfast cereal brand?`
>      Many expect that the answer will not be interesting. Yet, most people experience an urge to find out what it is. 
>      
>      2. `What are the genetic differences between Apes and Humans?`
>      Here, many expect the answer to be interesting. Yet, most people do not experience a strong urge to find out the answer right now.
>      
>      3. `What explorer wrote the famous reply poem to Christopher Marlowe's 1599 poem "The Passionate Shepherd to his love"?` 
>      Here most people expect that the answer will not be interesting, and they also do not have an urge to find out what it is.

Each participant was asked to rate both their urge and interest for each of the 143 questions on a 1-10 scale. 
### File structure 
The columns in the file are:

 1. **Question**: The question participants were asked to rate 
 2. **Interest**:    Mean interest rating across all participants 
 3. **Urge**: Mean urge rating across all participants 
 4. **Zinterest**: The ZScore of (Mean) Interest across all questions 
 5. **Zurge**: The ZScore of (Mean) Urge across all questions 
 6. **ZinterestTransformed**: The transformed Zinterest, equal to $(2*Z_{interest}-Z_{urge})$
 7. **ZurgeTransformed**: The transformed Zurge, equal to $(2*Z_{urge}-Z_{interest})$

## QuestionTopics.xslx

This excel file details the different semantic labels ("topics") associated with the 143 questions described in `QuestionRatings.xslx`.
There is a total of 29 topics. Each question was associated with one or more topics as judged by a panel of human classifiers. 

### File structure 
The columns in this file:

1. **Question**: The question
1. **label**: a label associated with this question

Note that a question may be associated with multiple labels, by appearing in multiple rows.

--------------------

## Topics.xlsx
The topic association detailed in `QuestionTopics.xslx`  were used together with the `QuestionRatings.xslx` to calculate Interest and Urge ratings for each topic, as described below. These were used to generate **Fig 1.a**.

### File structure 
The columns in this file:
1. **topic**: The 29 topic labels
1. **Interest**: Mean Interest rating of all questions associated with this label
1. **Urge**: Mean Urge rating all questions associated with this label
1. **ZInterestTransfromed**: Mean ZInterestTransfromed rating of all questions associated with this label
1. **ZUrgeTransfromed**: Mean ZUrgeTransfromed rating of all questions associated with this label
1. **NumberofQuestions**: Number of questions associated with this topic label


## CURIOSITY-participants_values.xlsx
Each value in this sheet reflects the Interest/Urge preference of one participant in one of the 4 experiments. Column names reflect the experiment and condition. 

*  For experiments 1,3,4: Values represent the proportion of choices in the interest question (calculated based on non excluded trials, see manuscript for more details).
*  For experiment 2: Values represent the mean preference (across all non excluded trials, see paper for more details), where 1 represents high preference for the high Urge question and 10 represents high preference for the high Interest question. 

### File structure 
First Row in spreadsheet: Name of experiment
Second Row: Name of condition
